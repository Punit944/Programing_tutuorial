The .btn classes are designed to be used with the <button> element. However,
you can also use these classes on <a> or <input> elements (though some 
browsers may apply a slightly different rendering).

When using button classes on <a> elements that are used to trigger in-page
functionality (like collapsing content), rather than linking to new pages 
or sections within the current page, these links should be given a role="button"
to appropriately convey their purpose to assistive technologies such as screen
readers.
